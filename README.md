#### :bar_chart: Javascript-Calculator
:octocat: Online calculator that allows multiple operations. Created with HTML, CSS and jQuery.
***
The idea for this project came from FreeCodeCamp, where the project is one of a total of 9 front-end development related projects. The calculator is responsive and has a flat-like, simple design style.
##### With this project, I learned to...   
– Make all number elements have an equal, grid-like margin between them.  
– Make each key pressed be displayed on the calculator screen.   
– Use a gradient as the background of the project.   
– Select HTML and CSS elements with jQuery and make them able to perform calculator operations.
