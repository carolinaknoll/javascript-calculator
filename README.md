#### :bar_chart: JavaScript-Calculator
:octocat: Online calculator that allows multiple operations. There are two versions: the first one was created with HTML, CSS and jQuery, which was then changed to Vanilla JavaScript. The second version was created using React, npm and Webpack.

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp [Frontend Libraries Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator/), and follows a series of requested user stories. You can open my [GitHub Pages version](http://carolinaknoll.github.io/javascript-calculator/) for this project and click 'Run Tests' on the FreeCodeCamp Test Suite on the top left corner to see the below tests pass. You can also view the code for the React version of this project.

- [x] User Story #1: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an = (equal sign) with a corresponding id="equals".
- [x] User Story #2: My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: id="zero", id="one", id="two", id="three", id="four", id="five", id="six", id="seven", id="eight", and id="nine".
- [x] User Story #3: My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: id="add", id="subtract", id="multiply", id="divide".
- [x] User Story #4: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a . (decimal point) symbol with a corresponding id="decimal".
- [x] User Story #5: My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id="clear".
- [x] User Story #6: My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id="display".
- [x] User Story #7: At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display.
- [x] User Story #8: As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display.
- [x] User Story #9: In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.
- [x] User Story #10: When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.
- [x] User Story #11: When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.
- [x] User Story #12: I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.
- [x] User Story #13: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered.
- [x] User Story #14: Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.
- [x] User Story #15: My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).

##### With this project, I learned to...
– Make all number elements have an equal, grid-like margin between them.   
– Make each key pressed be displayed on the calculator screen.   
– Use a gradient as the background of the project.   
– Use Regular Expressions to clean and format number operations according to the User Stories.   
– Select HTML and CSS elements with jQuery, and then with Vanilla JS, and make them able to perform calculator operations.
